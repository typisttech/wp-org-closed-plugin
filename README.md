## Why

When a plugin is closed on WordPress.org, [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) not always remove it from its database immediately.
As a result, some closed plugins remain available for installation via WPackagist.

Moreover, even if a plugin is closed, its existing versions are still downloadable from WordPress.org and the subversion repository.
```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "package",
      "package": {
        "name": "my-plugin/my-closed-plugin",
        "version": "1.0",
        "source": {
          "type": "svn",
          "url": "https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/my-closed-plugin/",
          "reference": "tags/1.0"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "package",
      "package": {
        "name": "your-plugin/your-closed-plugin",
        "version": "1.0",
        "dist": {
          "type": "zip",
          "url": "https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/your-closed-plugin.1.0.zip"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To catch these closed plugins, `WP Org Closed Plugin` queries [WordPress.org API](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API#Plugins) to check whether a plugin is closed and mark them as abandoned in Composer.

## What to do when a plugin is closed?

It depends on [why the plugin is closed](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/alerts-and-warnings/#reasons-why-plugins-are-closed).

For security concerns, stop using the plugin immediately.

For [plugin exodus](https://wptavern.com/developers-remove-plugins-from-wordpress-org-repository-after-acf-controversy), install the plugin via the new repository suggested by the plugin author.

For other reasons, do your own research.

## Caveats

### <q>No longer maintained</q>

Composer hardcodes the message <q>no longer maintained</q> for abandoned packages.

Plugins closed on WordPress.org may be [closed for various reasons](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/alerts-and-warnings/#reasons-why-plugins-are-closed) - some are permanent, some are temporary.
The message <q>no longer maintained</q> may not be accurate in some cases.

You should check the plugin's WordPress.org page for more details.

### <q>No replacement was suggested</q>

There is no way to suggest a replacement when closing a plugin on WordPress.org.

You should do your own research to find suitable replacements.

### Locked File

Since plugin closure might be temporary, `WP Org Closed Plugin` does not modify `composer.lock`.
Thus, `$ composer audit --locked` will not report closed plugins.

```console
$ composer audit --locked

# ...
Skipped checking for closed plugins because of --locked.
# ...
```

You should run `composer audit` without `--locked` to check for closed plugins.
